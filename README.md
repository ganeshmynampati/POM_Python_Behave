SALIENT FEATURES OF PYTHON AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK using BEHAVE

1. Created the framework using SELENIUM WEBDRIVER API with PYTHON as programming language.
2. Implemented BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (BDD) for easy understanding of requirements from client perspective using BEHAVE automation testing framework.
3. Web application under test is split in forms of pages and PAGE OBJECT MODEL (POM) approach is applied to represent the test components in a modular approach.
4. PAGE CHAINING CONCEPT is implemented to establish the concurrency between each page during page navigation.
5. Browser actions and test scripting is implemented based on OOP concept.
6. Use of GLOBAL keyword for module level access of variables.
7. Segregation of Page objects and Page actions into two classes for easy understanding.
8. Effective use of click and page scroll operations using Javascript methods.
9. Inheritance concept is applied between page classes and step definition classes.
10. Applied Python concepts such as GLOBAL,
11. DATA DRIVEN APPROACH - is achieved with the help of Scenario Outline concept of Cucumber. It facilitates testing scenario with multiple types of test data if required.
12. Handling of synchronization by using EXPLICIT WAIT (WEBDRIVER WAIT) wherever required during element interactions.
13.Ease of reusability is achieved in this framework by REUSABLE METHODS, they are created and maintained in a separate source folder and hence they can be called as many times as needed without the need to create a method which is used frequently.
14. Framework is integrated with ALLURE REPORT for enhanced presentation of test summary and results.
